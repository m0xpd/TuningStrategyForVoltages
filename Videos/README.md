# Video Examples
This folder contains links to videos demonstrating the tuning strategy.

[Tuning VOLTAGES - an Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFSsCZiciK8) provides a quick introduction to what the tuning strategy can achieve, 
by presenting examples of Tuning 23 (a Hexatonic Sequence) and Tuning 18 (Major Scale) from the Catalog in Section 13 of [the description](https://github.com/m0xpd/TuningStrategyForVoltages/blob/main/Documentation/A%20Tuning%20Strategy%20for%20Voltages.pdf).

[Tuning Voltages - Practical Examples (part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jBcZzdcgNY) provides a walk-through of how to set the 'Main Interval' 
(see section 5 of [the description](https://github.com/m0xpd/TuningStrategyForVoltages/blob/main/Documentation/A%20Tuning%20Strategy%20for%20Voltages.pdf) ) and goes on to set up the minor 7th tuning example seen in section 5, developing it with octave extensions. 
It closes with an extended version of the sequence, enhanced with a 'bass line' pulled from the sequence by a sample and hold.

The videos have been recorded with audio signals comprised of sine waves plus pulse waves, to ensure that they are audible on everything from smartphones to 
far-field monitors. It doesn't make for the nicest sound, but audibility was the most important consideration here.

More videos will follow when I get time and if I sense there's interest!
